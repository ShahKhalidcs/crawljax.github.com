In this release: 

* Crawljax doesn't accidentally go to other URLs anymore during a Crawl. [#339](https://github.com/crawljax/crawljax/issues/339)
* `StateVertexImpl.getUsedEventables()` Always returned an empty list [#350](https://github.com/crawljax/crawljax/issues/350)
* Fixed some Findbugs errors (thanks to [@keheliya](https://github.com/keheliya))

All binaries are available at [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.crawljax%22) and [GitHub](https://github.com/crawljax/crawljax/releases)
